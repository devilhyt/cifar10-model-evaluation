# CIFAR10 Model Evaluation

In the CIFAR10 classification task, we experimented with various methods using the same baseline model to improve accuracy.

## Result

| model                         | accuracy |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Baseline model                | 84.6%    |
| Dropout                       | 84.7%    |
| Batch Normalization           | 86.3%    |
| Dropout & Batch Normalization | 86.6%    |
